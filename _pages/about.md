I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Washington's [Center for an Informed Public](https://www.cip.uw.edu/). Previously, I undertook a PhD in Computational Social Science at University College London [(UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

## Research

My primary research area is polarization on social media, particularly as it relates to people's informational and cultural environments. I am interested in how sociopolitical divides contribute to, or are affected by, external factors like lifestyle choices and media consumption. Beyond that, I am also interested in how recommendation algorithms and social media network effects relate to polarization through homogenization.

## Personal

I was born in Limassol, Cyprus. In my free time, you will catch me reading anything from fantasy books to non-fiction, playing the guitar, writing music, homebrewing, or experimenting with new food recipes (to varying levels of success). When I can't be bothered to do any of those, I'll probably be playing whatever caught my eye on Steam that week.
