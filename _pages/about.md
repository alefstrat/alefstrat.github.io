I am an incoming Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Washington's [Center for an Informed Public](https://www.cip.uw.edu/). Previously, I undertook a PhD in Computational Social Science at University College London [(UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

## Research

I analyze the sociocognitive aspects of why misinformation proliferates online, and why trends of polarization are continually rising. My research takes the view that polarization can create a fertile environment for misinformation to proliferate, and examines the effects of social media on informational environment health. In my work, I view these topics from the lens of misperceptions about ground realities, outgroups, et cetera, and I employ computational social science methods to understand and intervene in these online harms.

## Personal

I was born in Limassol, Cyprus. I like to spend my free time as creatively as I can, and I usually spend it playing guitar or writing music, editing videos, experimenting with new food recipes (usually unsuccessfully), or reading non-fiction. When I can't be bothered to do any of those, I'll probably be playing whatever's on sale on Steam that week.
